/**
 * An interface for a {@link VirtualMachine} into the kernel.
 *
 * <p>This interface has some caveats both concerning how it must be implemented and how it must be
 * used by a {@link VirtualMachine}.
 *
 * <p>In terms of implementation, the following must be true: - After a kernel interface calls
 * {@code commitTo()}, it must still retain ALL of its state changes.
 *
 * <p>It is up to the discretion of the implementing class whether or not {@code commit()} causes
 * the kernel interface that performs the action to lose its state changes or not.
 *
 * <p>In terms of how a {@link VirtualMachine} must use this class: - All verification checks on a
 * transaction must be performed via this class. In particular, the following four methods must be
 * used:
 *
 * <p>{@code accountNonceEquals()}: to check the sender's nonce. {@code accountBalanceIsAtLeast()}:
 * to check for sufficient funds. {@code isValidEnergyLimitForCreate()}: to check the transaction
 * energy limit for CREATE. {@code isValidEnergyLimitForNonCreate()}: to check the transaction
 * energy limit otherwise.
 *
 * <p>- All internal calls must first call into the following method to determine whether or not the
 * call can be made into the specified destination address:
 *
 * <p>{@code destinationAddressIsSafeForThisVM()}.
 *
 * <p>- Prior to running the transaction logic, the sender account must be deducted the full cost of
 * the energy fees. This deduction MUST be done only by calling into this method:
 *
 * <p>{@code deductEnergyCost()}.
 *
 * <p>- After running the transaction logic, depending on the success of the logic, the sender
 * account will be refunded for the energy it does not use. This refunding MUST be done only by
 * calling into this method:
 *
 * <p>{@code refundAccount()}.
 *
 * <p>- After running the transaction logic, depending on whether the transaction is rejected or
 * not, the miner must be paid its fees. These fees MUST be paid only by calling into this method:
 *
 * <p>{@code payMiningFee()}.
 *
 * <p>The reason that the {@link VirtualMachine} must use the above methods as specified is because
 * the kernel may use some special logic in each of these cases depending on the context of the
 * transaction, and this logic is a kernel-level concern not a VM concern. These explicit calls for
 * these cases allow the kernel to gain control over each of these precisely defined events, which
 * it may need.
